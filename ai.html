          programs</b

        human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods
        that are biologically observable (McCarthy, 2004)." The birth of the
        artificial intelligence conversation was denoted by Alan Turing's
        "Computer Machinery and Intelligence", offering a test called "Turing
        Test" that allowed human interrogator to distinguish between a computer
        and human text response. As the field of AI is expanding dramatically,
        most popular topics in AI are

            Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can
            improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It
            is used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine,
            email filtering, speech recognition, and computer vision, where it
            is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to
            perform the needed tasks.

          <dt>Neural Network</dt>
          <dd>
            A neural network is an artificial neural network composed of
            artificial neurons or nodes. It is used for predictive modeling,
            adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a
            dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within
            networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly
            unrelated set of information
          </dd>
          <dt>Evolutionary Computation</dt>
          <dd>
            Evolutionary computation is a family of algorithms for global
            optimization inspired by biological evolution, and the subfield of
            artificial intelligence. It produces highly optimized solutions in a
            wide range of problem settings, and used in evolutionary biology as
            an in silico experimental procedure to study common aspects of
            general evolutionary processes.
          </dd>
          <dt>Computer Vision</dt>
          <dd>
            Computer vision is about how computers can gain high-level
            understanding from digital images or videos. The scientific
            discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind
            artificial systems that extract information from images. Sub-domains
            of computer vision include scene reconstruction, object detection,
            event detection, video tracking, object recognition, 3D pose
            estimation, visual servoing, 3D scene modeling, and image
            restoration.
          </dd>
          <dt>Natural Language Processing</dt>
          <dd>
            Natural language processing (NLP) is about how to program computers
            to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The
            goal is a computer capable of understanding the contents of
            documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within
            them. The technology can then accurately extract information and
            insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and
            organize the documents themselves. Challenges in natural language
            processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language
            understanding, and natural language generation.
