          Hi! I'm David Dongmin Oh. I came from South Korea and currently
          studying computer science at University of Wisconsin Madison. My
          interest is in backend developemnt and AI. I have done some projects
          mainly focusing on backend development and recent project is Bitcoin
          autotrading system that is based on Python. I've also taken some AI
          online courses and currently taking AI course at UW-Madison as well.
          After graduation, I want to work as a backend develper. My ultimate
          goal as a programer is to make the world better as a computer expert.
